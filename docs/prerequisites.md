# Prerequisites

In terms of the development environment, make sure you installed Nodejs globally in your machine. You will also need to use node package managers during this series.
guide to install nodejs in your machine

In this series, I will be using Visual Studio Code as my main editor and I highly recommended using it.

- Install [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) in your machine.
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

And make sure you can run, `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal.

```bash
node -v
#  v18.12.1
```

```bash
npm -v
#  8.19.2
```
