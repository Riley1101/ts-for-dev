guide to install nodejs in your machine

In this series, I will be using Visual Studio Code as my main editor and I highly recommended using it.

- Install [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) in your machine.
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

And make sure you can run, `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal.

```bash
node -v
#  v18.12.1
```

```bash
npm -v
#  8.19.2
```
